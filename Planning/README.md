This program shows the topic of Planning in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It uses the real-world problem of planning which sequence of steps to take to get from a starting state to the end state, represented as toast is toasted and on the plate.

The function gets a start state as input and outputs a python list of actions that fulfill the goal

It's implemented in the three following ways (with rising difficulty):

1. Implements breadth first search.
   -> planning_toast_1

2. Implements a function that also optimizes the final value of the parameter "time"
   -> planning_toast_2

3. Implements a function that fulfills 2) and is as fast as possible!
   -> planning_toast_3
