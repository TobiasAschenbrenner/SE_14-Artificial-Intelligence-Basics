The game of Nim is played with two players, starting with a number of piles, with each pile containing a number of objects. On each player's turn, they must remove any number of objects from a single pile. The person to remove the last object from the game loses.

In this program, an AI uses reinforcement learning to teach itself to play the game Nim. The AI trains itself by playing 10000 games against itself before playing against the user.
